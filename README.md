# BLAZESOFT TAKEHOME TEST SUBMISSION

## Technical overview
- redux/reduxtoolkit
- nextjs 14 with app router
- react-hook-forms
- tailwindcss

## ENHANCEMENTS NOTES
Wish I could have implemented:

- Error handling for empty form values
- Error handling for improper text input like currency
- Proper Typescript types folder with deffinitions 
- notifications for successful or failed crud operations
- A more elegant modal solution, perhaps another redux implementation for modals
    - currently a useState solution, would revisit that if time allowed
- UI/UX improvements
- Using grid to layout the table instead of flexbox
- in the modal, click outside the close button or form to also close the modal
- A better visual update for CRUD operations to indicate change
- a more responsive design for smaller screens and phones
