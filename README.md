# BLAZESOFT TAKEHOME TEST SUBMISSION

## How to run locally

1. Ensure npm is installed on computer
2. Clone repository to desired location
3. Open a terminal instance in repository and run npm install


## NOTES
Wish I could have implemented:

- Error handling for empty form values
- A more elegant modal solution, perhapse another redux implementation for modals
- UI/UX improvements
- Using grid to layout the table instead of flexbox
- in the modal, click outside the close button or form to also close the modal
- A better visual update for CRUD operations to indicate change
